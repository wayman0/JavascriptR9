   Transform each {@link Vertex} of a {@link Model} from
   view coordinates to normalized camera coordinates.
<p>
   This stage transforms the {@link Camera}'s view volume from a
   user defined shape (in the view coordinate system) into the
   standard normalized view volume (in the camera coordinate system)
   used by the {@link Clip} pipeline stage.
<p>
   There are two standard normalized view volumes, one for perspective
   projection and one for orthographic projection.
<p>
   The standard normalized perspective view volume is the infinitely
   long pyramid with its apex at the origin and intersecting the plane
   {@code z = -1} at the corners {@code (-1, -1, -1)} and
   {@code (+1, +1, -1)}.
<p>
   The standard normalized orthographic view volume is the infinitely
   long parallelepiped centered on the z-axis and intersecting the
   xy-plane at the corners {@code (-1, -1, 0)} and {@code (+1, +1, 0)}.
<p>
   The user defined view volume (determined by the {@link Scene}'s
   {@link Camera} object) is either the infinitely long pyramid with its
   apex at the origin and intersecting the plane {@code z = -near} at the
   corners {@code (left, bottom, -near)} and {@code (right, top, -near)},
   or it is the infinitely long parallelepiped parallel to the z-axis and
   intersecting the xy-plane at the corners {@code (left, bottom, 0)}
   and {@code (right, top, 0)}.
<p>
   The view coordinate system is relative to the user defined view volume.
<p>
   The normalized camera coordinate system is relative to the normalized
   view volume.
<p>
   The transformation formulas that transform the user defined view volume
   into the normalized view volume also transforms the view coordinate
   system into the normalized camera coordinate system.
